# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning


## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive project for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques and various natural language processing techniques. The project includes data analysis, model training, and a web application for real-time fake news detection. The machine learning model is designed to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content.

## Problem Definition
We aim to develop a machine learning program to identify when a news source may be producing fake news. The model will focus on identifying fake news sources, based on multiple articles originating from a source. Once a source is labeled as a producer of fake news, we can predict with high confidence that any future articles from that source will also be fake news. Focusing on sources widens our article misclassification tolerance, because we will have multiple data points coming from each source.

The intended application of the project is for use in applying visibility weights in social media. Using weights produced by this model, social networks can make stories that are highly likely to be fake news less visible.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories and files:
- **Images**: Contains important project images, such as block diagrams, classification reports, confusion matrices, and screenshots.
- **dataset**: Includes the dataset, consisting of train and test data from Kaggle, which is used to train and test the model.
- **static**: Houses static assets for the web application, including CSS, JavaScript, etc.
- **templates**: Includes HTML templates for the web application, such as `Landingpage.html` and `prediction page.html`.
- **Fake_News_Detector-PA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file for data analysis and model training.
- **app.py**: Flask web application for real-time fake news detection.
- **model.pkl**: Pre-trained machine learning model for fake news detection.
- **vector.pkl**: Pre-trained vectorizer for text data.
